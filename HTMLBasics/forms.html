<h1>Forms</h1>
<!--Used to collect input, usually from users and stuff
such as log ins, and search bars-->
<!--
Uses <form> & </form> Tags (shocker i know)
Needs 2 attributes to function properly
    1. Action: Page that processes the form
       (usually uses javaScript in this class, but that's not secure)
    2. Method: Two options
        1. Get: Gets the info put into the for (Like search bars)
        2. Post: Posts user info directly to server (Like Logins)
-->
